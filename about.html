	Interview: Why We are Drawn To Dessie Jackson<br><br>
	"I met Dessie Jackson outside of a party last month. Instead of waiting in line for the doors to open, we decided to head over to the bar next door to grab a beer and chat. We talked about mutual friends, our shared love for summer time in Philly, and Jackson briefly mentioned her artistic ability. Upon entering the party, I quickly realized how modest she had been about her skills. Through out the evening she was approached by multiple party goers, fans even, who praised her for her work.
	<br><br>
	Jackson’s pieces have certainly been attracting attention. She has recently been featured in Complex and JUMP Magazine. She was commissioned to create the cover art for Gilbere Forte‘s single “Nolita”, and she was chosen to design a T-shirt for The Hundreds. I should also mention that Jackson is a full-time student at Tyler School of Art. To say that she’s got a full plate would certainly be an understatement.
	<br><br>
	A few weeks after the party, I headed over to Jackson’s apartment to get a look at her creative space. The walls of her living room were adorned with large canvases filled with these evocative and striking images of women. As we kicked back, we spoke about her subjects, her musical inspiration, and the real life situations that evoke her artistic vision."
